    caption: A public showers’ user rest at the entrance of the Public Baths of Via
      Bianzé in Turin, Italy, on December 06, 2018. The city of Turin still runs
      4 communal baths - part of a much bigger series of 15 buildings erected
      between 1900 and 1960 - offering a basic service for those living in harsh
      housing conditions. Since the beginning of the XX century, Public Baths in
      Turin played a key role in mitigating the systemic housing crisis,
      worsened in the past years due to the city’s economic downfall.

Rising Water is a multimedia documentary project on the role of public showers in Turin’s housing struggle.

Communal toilets on balconies, overcrowded apartments, occupied factories, derelict campers, waiting lists for subsidised housing, bailiffs and forced evictions

The most used word in Italy’s last public showers is as simple as, apparently, unattainable: home.

Housing costs account for 36% of the annual expenses incurred by an average Italian family. 2017 saw 32,069 forced evictions, of which 2,799 took place in Turin alone. At an average of seven a day, Turin has the highest eviction figures of all Italian cities.

To cope with its systemic housing crisis – exacerbated by the economic collapse of the 2000s – the city of Turin still runs 4 communal baths offering a basic service for those living in harsh housing conditions. It can be seen as an outdated memory of the past, but municipal baths hide stories of social cohesion and solidarity, still playing a key role in the struggle for a shelter. 

While being a needed service, the very existence of these public showers clearly shows the breakdown of our society: the failure of the right to a decent accommodation.
