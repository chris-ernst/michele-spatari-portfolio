The Great Karoo, or land of thirst, is a semi-desert natural region in South Africa with no apparent clear boundaries. It formed an impenetrable barrier to the interior for the Europeans settlers, a frightening place of great heat, frosts, floods, and droughts: a “Place of Great Dryness”.

Few years ago, I urged an escape. I embarked in a road trip in the Karoo, an area I hadn’t explored yet.

What I discovered in those few days, changed the way I use the photographic medium. On the second day of the trip, we met Johan in Graff-Reinet, sporting a hippie like Mona Lisa t-shirt while making his way through the thick path of his succulent nursery, one of the biggest in the world. Once a criminal lawyer dispatched to the Karoo to defend freedom fighters, the tall of a life passed side by side with vicious crimes made him cut tie with the world. Waiting to abandon even more, leaving behind even his last possessions and yearning for the day the man who inhabits the house he bought in Nieu-Bethesda would die.

I had to pursue that strong feeling Johan and the Karoo gave me.

“This story sounds a bit unbelievable, but it happened a very long time ago. It happened before there were towns like Graff-Reinet or Nieu-Bethesda. Before there were farms and permanent settlements. It happened when people were the intruders and the land belonged to the wild.”

A haunting, biblical landscape that seems to sweep on forever. In the Karoo, South Africa’s troubled history emerges in an atlas of places and stories tied together by the ephemeral, the wild, the unknown. A space frozen in time where the boundary of reality intertwines with magic, a time for dreamers and loners, amid a seven-year-long drought that is taking a hard toll on the people, the animals, the land.

In Victoria West, packs of nervous amateur players sweep like locusts a dry golf course where motor oil is poured around holes to make the putting green, wide black circles in the scorched earth. Out of town, actual swarms of locusts thicken the air, “they were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads”. In Nieu-Bethesda, a feared God shines out of the biblical sculpted world of Helen Martin, who devoted her last thirty years converting her family home into a unique fantasy, which she named the Owl House. Black inked tattoos peek out from the earth-colored shirt Joy is wearing while wondering outside her shack on the outskirt of town, so like Helen Martins’ creatures but made armful by the young woman bright, vivid eyes.

Ballads from the End of the Desertis a visual exploration of this biblical land at the heart of South Africa.
